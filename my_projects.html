                This camp reservation website was created for my web development with .NET class. 
                It was a group project that had little to no instruction from the 
                professor. We were given a "customer" who had requirements and 
                we as a group had to decide how to approach creating it. It was a 
                great learning experience. We used the MEAN web stack  (MySQL, 
                Express.js, AngularJS, and Node.js) and attempted 
                to utilize an AGILE approach to creating it. The main features of this 
                web app are creating and managing an account, creating and managing 
                reservations, reservation management by an admin, and a simulated 
                purchasing enviroment.

                The banking project I completed was done in a similar approach to 
                the camp reservation project, however it was a solo project and 
                more lead by my professor. He provided the requirements and we 
                had to build it from scratch. It was a great opportunity to strengthen 
                my skills in both frontend, backend, and database development. The main 
                features in this application are creating an account, depositing money, 
                transfering money, admin management, and employee management.

                This project was for my The Internet of Things class. In this class we learned 
                about IoT devices and the different practical uses. Throughout 
                the course we created different guided projects in order 
                to learn the capabilities of our arduino board. We utilized tools 
                such as a moisture sensor, a motion sensor, and the sensors built 
                into our IoT arduino board. At the end of the semester we were 
                given the freedom to create whatever we could think of. I decided 
                to create a dog feeder. The arduino board was connected to a 
                cardboard box and utilized the motion sensor, moisture sensor, 
                and a small motor. The motion sensor tracked interation between 
                the system and the dog. The moisture sensor tracked whether 
                or not the water bowl was full. The motor was used to open 
                and close a small hole at the bottom that would allow dog food 
                to flow out on demand.

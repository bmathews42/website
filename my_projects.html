                    The vinyl tracking system is the first personal project I have completed. My main goal
                    was to demonstrate the new application development skills I had learned while implementing
                    a few new skills as well. The pages are written in HTML. I used Bootstrap for the CSS
                    stylesheet. The data is all stored in mySQL. This was my first time implementing an
                    API into an application. I used last.fm in order to get the cover art for each album along 
                    with the album information for the profile pages. Through this process I learned how to 
                    efficiently traverse data in JSON form while utilizing REST API.

                    This camp reservation website was created for my web development with .NET class. 
                    It was a group project that had little to no instruction from the 
                    professor. We were given a "customer" who had requirements and 
                    we as a group had to decide how to approach creating it. It was a 
                    great learning experience. We used the MEAN web stack (MySQL, 
                    Express.js, AngularJS, and Node.js) and attempted 
                    to utilize an AGILE approach to creating it. The main features of this 
                    web app are creating and managing an account, creating and managing 
                    reservations, reservation management by an admin, and a simulated 
                    purchasing environment.

                    The banking project I completed was done in a similar approach to 
                    the camp reservation project, however it was a solo project and 
                    more lead by my professor. He provided the requirements and we 
                    had to build it from scratch. It was a great opportunity to strengthen 
                    my skills in both frontend, backend, and database development. The main 
                    features in this application are creating an account, depositing money, 
                    transferring money, admin management, and employee management.

                    This project was for my The Internet of Things class. In this class we learned 
                    about IoT devices and the different practical uses. Throughout 
                    the course we created different guided projects in order 
                    to learn the capabilities of our Arduino board. We utilized tools 
                    such as a moisture sensor, a motion sensor, and the sensors built 
                    into our IoT Arduino board. At the end of the semester we were 
                    given the freedom to create whatever we could think of. I decided 
                    to create a dog feeder. The Arduino board was connected to a 
                    cardboard box and utilized the motion sensor, moisture sensor, 
                    and a small motor. The motion sensor tracked interaction between 
                    the system and the dog. The moisture sensor tracked whether 
                    or not the water bowl was full. The motor was used to open 
                    and close a small hole at the bottom that would allow dog food 
                    to flow out on demand.

                        Microsoft’s ASP.NET Core is a cross-platform, high-performance web 
                        framework for building full stack web applications. This course will 
                        introduce students to the syntax and programmatic idioms of ASP.NET/C#. 
                        The following topics will be covered: REST, Razor, Model Binding and 
                        Validation, Entity Framework and the MVC design pattern. Client-side 
                        development libraries will also be discussed and integrated, so that 
                        student can build and deploy a full stack application.

                        This course addresses the design of scripting languages and their 
                        applications. Scripting languages can be used to manipulate text and 
                        data using subtle and complex coding to automate many tasks. Students 
                        will learn to write simple scripts to automate system administration 
                        tasks using appropriate languages. This course explores the nature of 
                        scripting, the role of scripting languages, introduces some of the 
                        popular scripting languages and their applications, and provides skills 
                        in scripting language design.

                        a capstone experience that integrates the material contained in the 
                        CS curriculum through work on a software project that applies this 
                        material. Projects are chosen so as to provide an interdisciplinary 
                        service learning component with project proposals being solicited 
                        from the community at large. Projects that integrate students and 
                        faculty from other disciplines are also encouraged. Lectures will 
                        be directed towards the software development lifecycle, requirements 
                        gathering and design documentation, as well as software project 
                         management. Each team member will contribute to all phases of the 
                         project as well as the development of a project prototype.

                        Computers are essential to modern life, yet most people use them 
                        with no understanding of how they accomplish everything they do. 
                        This course will explore how computers function from a technical 
                        perspective, allowing students to see why they work and are designed 
                        the way they are. The course will focus on Von Neumann computers, 
                        covering a variety of topics including logic gates, basic digital 
                        circuit concepts, number and data representation, the processor
